# Console-based-Calculator
This is a console-based calculator app using SwiftUI for the ironhack iOS bootcamp

## Reflections
I found this lab quite good because it helped me practice what was learned in the class. 
The calculator app has a while loop that runs until the user inputs "n". It will ask you for the numbers first and then the operation. It didnt prove to be dificult to implement, however in the bootcamp class, we were trying to use the "?" for optional inputing, this proved to be a bit confusing at first but after reviewing the class I was able to understand the concept better.
